DAT405 / GAD405 Creative Coding  
(Fall 2017)
===========================================

__Session 1__

This is an introduction to DAT405/GAD405 Creative Coding. Main artists and practices will be discussed during the session so as provide a good overview about the topic. Following the analysis and discussion, the students are exposed to the tools that are necessary for this module:  
* Atom https://atom.io  
* Github https://github.com  
* P5.js https://p5js.org  
* Chrome https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html  

After the setup of the software and configuring a main project using the templates provided, there is a demonstration in relation to drawing basics (text, color, shapes). Finally the students are asked to complete a series of exercises (code will be available after the submission deadline).
