DAT405 / GAD405 Creative Coding  
(Fall 2017)
===========================================

__Session 3__

In this session we will explore variables in Javascript and P5.js and understand the differences between var, let, and const. Following that we will discuss and practice for-loops and nesting, and generate visual content in a more dynamic and efficient way. In addition, we will see how to include images in our sketches, how to process them, and also how to generate visual content utilizing for-loops. Students are expected to follow the class examples and develop their own individual work via the assignments given in class.
