Plymouth University, Fall 2017__

Computational tools and platforms have allowed a new era of creativity across multiple media, systems, and modes of interaction. In this course, students will utilize contemporary development tools and programming frameworks to build novel media systems, games, and applications, using mainly Javascript and the P5.Js and Phaser.Js libraries. Additionally, HTML and CSS will be introduced to define the structure and look of the finalized projects. This twenty-credit module will be delivered for a duration of 5 weeks for this semester (Fall 2017).

##Evaluation
Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
* Assignment 1: 50%
* Assignment 2: 50%

Homework and class exercises will be given in every session, which are required to complete in the time given. Each student will be asked to demonstrate this work through their individual Github accounts. Being punctual in these responsibilities is necessary in completing this module.

Attendance is mandatory in all sessions. Please inform your lecturers via email if you are going to miss a class. Habitually showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences the Administration Office will be automatically be alerted, triggering a series of processes that could adversely affect your grade or even create problems for passing the module.
